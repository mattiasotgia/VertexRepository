# ICARUS DL vertex creation algorithm

This repository holds all the code/utilities/analyses relative to the implementation of the DL-based vertex creation algorithm in the ICARUS Pandora-based reconstruction chain

## Subdirectories

1. [LArMachineLearningData](https://github.com/mattiasotgia/LArMachineLearningData) containes all the required code to be able to train the ML algorithms inside Pandora. The documentation is all contained inside. \
A description of the work performed, the timeline of the status of this work and details of the findings is kept in [vertexUtilities/README.md](vertexUtilities/README.md). 

2. [sceStudies](sceStudies/README.md) is the TOP directory for some _parallel_ SpaceChargeEffects studies.
